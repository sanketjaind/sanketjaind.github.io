We learned how people from different region speak different accent.
Neutral Accent- It means speak with a standard pronunciation, intonation and tone so that we do not
sound like that we from specific region instead of sounding global .
How to improve Neutral Accent-
• Work on pronunciation.

Those skills that are required to deliver effective presentation in front of audience.
Five keys of effective presentaion:

make effective presentation.

something that makes people admire you.

SS4- Conversation Skills:
Conversation skills in the corporate world is very important. Even though we may have necessary
qualification and technical skills but if we do not have good conversation skills then we would not
be able to visible in the workplace or we might miss the oppurtunity to level up in our career.
Converstaion can be broken down into five steps:
• Plan- It needs to have a clear objective in our mind. We should have a proper topic before
we start our conversation.
• Prepare- We should be prepared before start converstaion. It means we should have some
predefined lines that will help to start conversation.
• Listen- We should always listen carefully what speaker says. We should listen with an intent
to understand not with an intent to reply.
• Close- After having conversation, we should close conversation on a positive note. It should
have some predifined lines like ' It was pleasure meeting you or it was nice talking to you'.
• Along the way- We should ask doubts and clarify those doubts while having convaesation.
We can ask doubts or give some suggessions through out the conversation.

SS5- Listening Skills:
Only having good conversation skills, it does not mean that we are very good with our language or
we are good in communication. We should have good listening skills also. Because it helps us to
understand each other's message and how should we act on that message accordingly.

Five levels of Listening Skills:

1. Ignoring- This is the first and worst level of listening where listner completely ignores the
speaker. It could be happened when listner is not very keen in listning or when listner is not
interested in the topic which is going on.

2. Pretending- This is the second level of listening where listner will try to show that he is
listening but in reality he doesn't. It could be happened when listner is disturbed because of
some external distractions or he is preoccupied with other thoughts.

3. Selective- This is the third level of listening where the listner listens certain parts of the
conversation and ignores the rest. It could be happened when the listner already knows
about the topic. Demerit is that we might miss out some valuable information.

4. Attentive- This is the fourth and good form of listening where listner keenly listens to the
speaker's message. It is important because the understandability of the listner cannot be
validated due to lack of interaction.

5. Active- This is the fifth and best level of listening where listner is ready to listen and also
ready for the interaction with the speaker. Listner always tries to focus on the speaker with
an intent to understand and also ready to ask questions.

message.

communication according to audience category, this is called Audience Orientation.
Flows of communication:

These flows vary according to Role and Designation, Knowledge Level and Language Proficiency.

designation of audience.

english in a very simple manner with a non-native english person.

writing. 'However, moreover, these are the examples of discourse markers.
